       " 13: '1\\nCHAPTER 1\\nINTRODUCTION\\nP roject Management Institute (PMI) practice standards are guides to the use of a tool, technique, or process\\nidentifi ed in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge ( PMBOK ® G uide – Fourth Edition) or\\nother PMI standards. Practice standards are targeted at audiences who participate in the management of\\nprojects. This includes project managers, project personnel, contract personnel, supervisors, and other project\\nstakeholders.\\nA PMI practice standard describes processes, activities, inputs, and outputs for a specifi c Knowledge Area.\\nIt provides information on what the signifi cant process, tool, or technique is, what it does, why it is signifi cant,\\nwhen it should be performed or executed, and, if necessary for further clarifi cation, who should perform the\\nprocess. A practice standard does not prescribe how the process is to be implemented, leaving that subject for\\nother forums such as handbooks, manuals, and courses.\\nThis chapter includes the following sections:\\n1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n1.2 Project Risk Management Defi nition\\n1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management\\n1.4 Good Risk Management Practice\\n1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 14: '1\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n1.1 Purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\nT he purpose of the Practice Standard for Project Risk Management is to ( a ) provide a standard for project\\nmanagement practitioners and other stakeholders that defi nes the aspects of Project Risk Management that\\nare recognized as good practice on most projects most of the time and (b ) provide a standard that is globally\\napplicable and consistently applied. This practice standard has a descriptive purpose rather than one used for\\ntraining or educational purposes.\\nThe Practice Standard for Project Risk Management covers risk management as it is applied to single\\nprojects only. Like the P MBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition, this practice standard does not cover risk in programs\\nor portfolios of projects.\\nC hapter 11 of the P MBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition, is the basis for the P ractice Standard for Project Risk\\nManagement . This practice standard is consistent with that chapter, emphasizing the concepts and principles\\nrelating to Project Risk Management. It is aligned with other PMI practice standards.\\nFigure 1-1 compares the purposes of this practice standard to those of the P MBOK ® G uide – Fourth Edition\\nand textbooks, handbooks, and courses.\\nFigure 1-1.

       " 15: '1\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\nThis practice standard is organized in three main sections:\\n1. I ntroductory material including the framework, purpose, principles, context of, and introduction to\\nProject Risk Management processes as defi ned in the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition.\\n2. Principles underlying the six Project Risk Management processes in the P MBOK ® G uide – Fourth\\nEdition. The six processes are as follows:\\n• Plan Risk Management,\\n• Identify Risks,\\n• Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis,\\n• Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis,\\n• Plan Risk Responses, and\\n• Monitor and Control Risks.\\nE ach of these six processes is described in a chapter that addresses the following four topics:\\n( a ) purpose and objectives of the process; (b ) critical success factors for the process; (c ) tools and\\ntechniques for the process; and ( d ) documenting the results of the process.\\n3. A glossary of terms which are used in this practice standard.\\nT his practice standard emphasizes those principles that are fundamental to effective, comprehensive,\\nand successful Project Risk Management. These principles can and should be stated at a general level for\\nseveral reasons:\\n1. P rinciples are expected to be agreed upon now and to be valid in the future. While tools and\\ntechniques are constantly evolving, the principles have more stability and persistence.\\n2. Different projects, organizations, and situations will require different approaches to Project Risk\\nManagement. In particular, risk management is a discipline that contains a series of processes to\\napply to both large and small projects. Risk management will be more effective if its practice is\\ntailored to the project and congruent with the organizational culture, processes and assets. There\\nare many different ways of conducting risk management that may comply with the principles of\\nProject Risk Management as presented in this practice standard.\\n3. The principles are applicable to projects carried out in a global context, refl ecting the many\\nbusiness and organizational arrangements between participants, for example, joint ventures\\nbetween commercial and national companies, government and non-government organizations,\\nand the cross-cultural environment often found on these project teams.\\nT he principles described herein can be used as a check for an organization’s processes. Practitioners can\\nestablish processes specifi c to their particular situation, project, or organization and then compare them with\\nthese principles, thus validating them against good Project Risk Management practice.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n3',\n",
       " 16: '1\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\n1.2 Project Risk Management Defi nition\\nT he defi nition of Project Risk Management, as defi ned in the P MBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition, is the basis\\nfor this practice standard: “Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting\\nrisk management planning, identifi cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project.” The\\nPMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition also states: “The objectives of Project Risk Management are to increase the\\nprobability and impact of positive events, and decrease the probability and impact of negative events in the\\nproject.” In the PMBOK ® G uide – Fourth Edition, “project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs,\\nhas a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives.” Project objectives include scope, schedule, cost,\\nand quality.\\nProject Risk Management aims to identify and prioritize risks in advance of their occurrence, and provide\\naction-oriented information to project managers. This orientation requires consideration of events that may\\nor may not occur and are therefore described in terms of likelihood or probability of occurrence in addition to\\nother dimensions such as their impact on objectives.\\n1.3 Role of Project Risk Management in Project Management\\nP roject Risk Management is not an optional activity: it is essential to successful project management.\\nIt should be applied to all projects and hence be included in project plans and operational documents. In\\nthis way, it becomes an integral part of every aspect of managing the project, in every phase and in every\\nprocess group.\\nMany of the project management processes address planning the project, from concept to fi nal design\\nand from procurement through daily management of execution and close-out. These processes often\\nassume an unrealistic degree of certainty about the project and, therefore, they need to include treatment of\\nproject risks.\\nProject Risk Management addresses the uncertainty in project estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it\\nbuilds upon and extends other project management processes. For instance, project scheduling provides dates\\nand critical paths based on activity durations and resource availability assumed to be known with certainty.\\nQuantitative risk analysis explores the uncertainty in the estimated durations and may provide alternative dates\\nand critical paths that are more realistic given the risks to the project.\\nProject Risk Management is not a substitute for the other project management processes. On the contrary,\\nProject Risk Management requires that these project management processes (e.g. scheduling, budgeting, and\\nchange management) be performed at the level of the best practices available. Project Risk Management adds\\nthe perspective of project risk to the outputs of those other processes and adds to their value by taking risk\\ninto account. For instance, risk management provides the basis upon which to estimate the amount of cost and\\nschedule contingency reserves that are needed to cover risk response actions to a required level of confi dence\\nfor meeting project objectives.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n4',\n",
       " 17: '1\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\nThere is a paradox about project risk that affects most projects. In the early stages of a project, the level of\\nrisk exposure is at its maximum but information on the project risks is at a minimum. This situation does not\\nmean that a project should not go forward because little is known at that time. Rather, there may be different\\nways of approaching the project that have different risk implications. The more this situation is recognized, the\\nmore realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be.\\nA risk management approach is applicable throughout a project’s life cycle. The earlier in the project life\\ncycle that the risks are recognized, the more realistic the project plans and expectations of results will be. Risk\\nmanagement continues to add value as project planning progresses and more information becomes available\\nabout all aspects and components of the project and its environment, such as stakeholders, scope, time, and\\ncost, as well as the corresponding assumptions and constraints. The balance between project fl exibility and\\nknowledge about project risk needs to be reviewed regularly and optimized as the plans develop.\\nI t is true that as the project plan becomes set with fundamental decisions, agreements, and contracts in\\nplace, the options for making substantial changes to capture opportunities or mitigate threats are reduced.\\nDuring project execution, risk management processes monitor the changes the project undergoes for new\\nrisks that may emerge so that appropriate responses to them can be developed, as well as check for existing\\nrisks that are no longer plausible. Project Risk Management plays a role in providing realistic expectations for\\nthe completion dates and cost of the project even if there are few options for changing the future.\\nF inally, throughout the project and during project closure, risk-related lessons are reviewed in order to\\ncontribute to organizational learning and support continuous improvement of Project Risk Management\\npractice.\\n1.4 Good Risk Management Practice\\nP roject Risk Management is a valuable component of project management and it enhances the value of\\nthe other project management processes. As with all of these processes, Project Risk Management should be\\nconducted in a manner consistent with existing organizational practices and policies. In addition, like the other\\nprocesses involved in project management, Project Risk Management should be conducted in a way that is\\nappropriate to the project. Project Risk Management should recognize the business challenges as well as the\\nmulti-cultural environment associated with an increasingly global environment including many joint venture\\nprojects and customers, suppliers, and workforces spread around the globe.\\nChanges in the project management plan that result from the Project Risk Management process may\\nrequire decisions at the appropriate level of management to reassign personnel, establish or modify budgets,\\nmake commitments to others outside the project, interact with regulators, and comply with the rules of\\naccounting and law. Project Risk Management should be conducted in compliance with these internal and\\nexternal requirements.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n5',\n",
       " 18: '1\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\nProject Risk Management should always be conducted on an ethical basis, in keeping with the Project\\nManagement code of ethics or conduct. Honesty, responsibility, realism, professionalism and fair dealing\\nwith others are among the characteristics of successful Project Risk Management. Effective Project Risk\\nManagement benefi ts from robust communication and consultation with stakeholders. This enables agreement\\namong stakeholders that Project Risk Management in general, and risk identifi cation, analysis, and response,\\nin particular, should be carried out in a realistic and objective way and should not be subject to political or other\\nunreasonable infl uences.\\nProject Risk Management should be conducted on all projects. The degree, level of detail, sophistication of\\ntools, and amount of time and resources applied to Project Risk Management should be in proportion to the\\ncharacteristics of the project under management and the value that they can add to the outcome. Thus, a large\\nproject that provides value to an important customer would theoretically require more resources, time, and\\nattention to Project Risk Management than would a smaller, short-term, internal project that can be conducted\\nin the background with a fl exible deadline.\\nE ach of the Project Risk Management processes should be scaled to be appropriate to the project under\\nmanagement during the Plan Risk Management process and reviewed periodically to determine if the decisions\\nmade in that process remain appropriate.\\n1.5 Critical Success Factors for Project Risk Management\\nFigure 1-2.

       " 19: '1\\nCHAPTER 1 − INTRODUCTION\\nS pecifi c criteria for success of each Project Risk Management process are listed in the chapters dealing\\nwith those processes. The general criteria for success include:\\n• Recognize the Value of Risk Management — Project Risk Management should be recognized\\nas a valuable discipline that provides a positive potential return on investment for organizational\\nmanagement, project stakeholders (both internal and external), project management, and team\\nmembers.\\n• Individual Commitment/Responsibility — Project participants and stakeholders should all accept\\nresponsibility for undertaking risk-related activities as required. Risk management is everybody’s\\nresponsibility.\\n• Open and Honest Communication — Everyone should be involved in the Project Risk Management\\nprocess. Any actions or attitudes that hinder communication about project risk reduce the effectiveness\\nof Project Risk Management in terms of proactive approaches and effective decision-making.\\n• Organizational Commitment — Organizational commitment can only be established if risk\\nmanagement is aligned with the organization’s goals and values. Project Risk Management may\\nrequire a higher level of managerial support than other project management disciplines because\\nhandling some of the risks will require approval of or responses from others at levels above the\\nproject manager.\\n• Risk Effort Scaled to Project — Project Risk Management activities should be consistent with the value\\nof the project to the organization and with its level of project risk, its scale, and other organizational\\nconstraints. In particular, the cost of Project Risk Management should be appropriate to its potential\\nvalue to the project and the organization.\\n• Integration with Project Management — Project Risk Management does not exist in a vacuum,\\nisolated from other project management processes. Successful Project Risk Management requires\\nthe correct execution of the other project management processes.\\nThese critical success factors for Project Risk Management are illustrated in Figure 1-2.\\n1.6 Conclusion\\nT he principles of Project Risk Management described in this practice standard should be appropriately\\napplied based on the specifi cs of a project and the organizational environment. Project Risk Management\\nprovides benefi ts when it is implemented according to good practice principles and with organizational\\ncommitment to taking the decisions and performing actions in an open and unbiased manner.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 21: '2\\nCHAPTER 2\\nPRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\n2.1 Introduction\\nT his chapter introduces the key ideas required to understand and apply Project Risk Management to projects\\nfollowing the approach described in Chapter 11 of the P MBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition. These principles and\\nconcepts are generally consistent with other approaches to Project Risk Management commonly used although\\nthe terminology may differ in some details.\\nThe execution of the Project Risk Management process is dealt with in subsequent chapters of this practice\\nstandard and so is not discussed here.\\n2.2 Defi nition of Project Risk\\nThe word “risk” is used in many ways in everyday language and in various specialist disciplines. Its use\\nin the P MBOK ® G uide – Fourth Edition is consistent with other risk management standards and process\\ndescriptions. The defi nition of project risk given in the PMBOK ® Guide – Fourth Edition is as follows:\\nP roject risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative\\neffect on a project’s objectives.\\nT his defi nition includes two key dimensions of risk: uncertainty and effect on a project’s objectives. When\\nassessing the importance of a project risk, these two dimensions must both be considered. The uncertainty\\ndimension may be described using the term “probability” and the effect may be called “impact” (though other\\ndescriptors are possible, such as “likelihood” and “consequence”).\\nT he defi nition of risk includes both distinct events which are uncertain but can be clearly described, and\\nmore general conditions which are less specifi c but also may give risk to uncertainty. T he defi nition of project\\nrisk also encompasses uncertain events which could have a negative effect on a project’s objectives, as\\nwell as those which could have a positive effect. These two types of risk are called, respectively, threats and\\nopportunities. It is important to address both threats and opportunities within a unifi ed Project Risk Management\\nprocess. This allows for the gain of synergies and effi ciencies such as addressing both in the same analyses\\nand coordinating the responses to both if they overlap or can reinforce each other.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n9',\n",
       " 22: '2\\nCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\nR isks are uncertain future events or conditions which may or may not occur, but which would matter if they\\ndid occur. It is important to distinguish risks from risk-related features, such as cause and effect. Causes are\\nevents or circumstances which currently exist or are certain to exist in the future and which might give rise\\nto risks. Effects are conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project\\nobjectives if the associated risk occurs. The cause-risk-effect chain can be used in a structured risk statement\\nor risk description to ensure that each of these three elements is properly described (see Section 5.3).\\nWhen a risk event occurs, it ceases to become uncertain. Threats which occur may be called issues or\\nproblems; opportunities which occur may be called benefi ts. Both issues/problems and benefi ts entail project\\nmanagement actions that are outside the scope of the Project Risk Management process.\\n2.3 Individual Risks and Overall Project Risk\\nIt is useful to consider project risk at two levels: individual risks and overall project risk.\\nI ndividual risks are specifi c events or conditions that might affect project objectives. An individual risk\\nmay positively or negatively affect one or more of the project objectives, elements, or tasks. Understanding\\nindividual risks can assist in determining how to apply effort and resources to enhance the chances of project\\nsuccess. Day-to-day Project Risk Management focuses on these individual risks in order to enhance the\\nprospects of a successful project outcome.\\nO verall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall project risk is\\nmore than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather than to individual\\nelements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations in project\\noutcome. It is an important component of strategic decision-making, program and portfolio management,\\nand project governance where investments are sanctioned or cancelled and priorities are set. At these higher\\nlevels, it is necessary to set realistic targets for the cost and duration of a project, establish the contingency\\nreserve levels required to protect the project stakeholders, set appropriate project priorities, and judge whether\\nthe risk of overall success is increasing or decreasing as implementation advances.\\n2.4 Stakeholder Risk Attitudes\\nT he risk attitudes of the project stakeholders determine the extent to which an individual risk or overall\\nproject risk matters. A wide range of factors infl uence risk attitude. These include the scale of the project\\nwithin the range of stakeholders’ overall activities, the strength of public commitments made about the\\nperformance of the project, and the stakeholders’ sensitivity to issues such as environmental impacts,\\nindustrial relations, and other factors. Stakeholder risk attitudes usually result in a desire for increased\\ncertainty in project outcomes, and may express a preference for one project objective over another. How risk\\nis regarded is usually also strongly infl uenced by an organization’s culture.

       " 23: '2\\nCHAPTER 2 − PRINCIPLES AND CONCEPTS\\nUnderstanding stakeholders’ attitudes toward risk is an important component of risk management planning\\nthat precedes risk identifi cation and analysis, in order to optimize both project success and stakeholder\\nsatisfaction with the project’s results. These attitudes should be identifi ed and managed proactively and\\ndeliberately throughout the Project Risk Management process. They may differ from one project to another\\nfor the same stakeholders and will usually differ from one group of stakeholders to another. In fact a single\\nstakeholder may adopt different risk attitudes at various stages in the same project.\\nI t is also important to understand the particular implications of stakeholder risk attitudes on projects where\\nthe team is international, cross-industry, or multi-organizational.\\n2.5 Iterative Process\\nIt is the nature of projects that circumstances change as they are being planned and executed. The amount\\nof information available about risks will usually increase as time goes on. Some risks will occur while others will\\nnot, new risks will arise or be discovered, and the characteristics of those already identifi ed may change. As a\\nresult, the Project Risk Management processes should be repeated and the corresponding plans progressively\\nelaborated throughout the lifetime of the project.\\nT o ensure that Project Risk Management remains effective, the identifi cation and analysis of risks should\\nbe revisited periodically, the progress on risk response actions should be monitored, and the action plans\\nadjusted accordingly. If external circumstances change signifi cantly, it may also be necessary to revisit the risk\\nmanagement planning process.\\nThe development of an initial risk management plan and risk assessment is the start of the process, not\\nthe end. The frequency and depth of reviews and updates will depend on the nature of the project, the volatility\\nof the environment in which the project is being implemented, and the timing of other project management\\nreviews and updates.\\n2.6 Communication\\nP roject Risk Management cannot take place in isolation. Success relies heavily on communication\\nthroughout the process.\\nR isk identifi cation and analysis depend on comprehensive input from stakeholders in a project to ensure\\nthat nothing signifi cant is overlooked and that risks are realistically assessed. The credibility of the process\\nand the commitment of those who should act to manage risks can be assured only if the way the process\\noperates and the conclusions it produces are understood and seen as credible by all concerned. This demands\\neffective and honest communication from the Project Risk Management process to the rest of the project team\\nand other project stakeholders. Communication of the results of the Project Risk Management process should\\nbe targeted to meet the specifi c needs of each stakeholder and should be refl ected within the overall project\\ncommunications strategy with each stakeholder’s responsibility and role in risk management identifi ed and\\nagreed-upon.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Project Risk\\nManagement should be included as an integral part of all other project processes. Since project risks can\\naffect project objectives, anyone with an interest in achieving those objectives should play a role in Project Risk\\nManagement. The specifi c roles depend on the project team members’ and other stakeholders’ place within\\nthe project and their relation to project objectives. Roles and responsibilities for Project Risk Management\\nshould be clearly defi ned and communicated, and individuals should be held responsible and accountable\\nfor results. This includes allocating responsibility for specifi c activities within the risk process, as well as for\\nresulting actions required to implement agreed-upon responses. Responsibility should also be allocated for\\nensuring that risk-related lessons are captured for future use.\\n2.8 Project Manager’s Role for Project Risk Management\\nThe project manager has particular responsibilities in relation to the Project Risk Management process.\\nThe project manager has overall responsibility for delivering a successful project which fully meets the defi ned\\nobjectives.

Uncertainty is inevitable since projects are unique and temporary undertakings\\nbased on assumptions and constraints, delivering project results to multiple stakeholders with different\\nrequirements. Project management can be seen as an attempt to control this uncertain environment, through\\nthe use of structured and disciplined techniques such as estimating, planning, cost control, task allocation,\\nearned value analysis, monitoring and review meetings, etc. Each of these elements of project management\\nhas a role in defi ning or controlling the uncertainty which is inherent in all projects.\\nP roject Risk Management provides an approach by which uncertainty can be understood, assessed, and\\nmanaged within projects. As such it forms an integral part of project management, and effective Project Risk\\nManagement is a critical success factor for project success.\\nF or project management to be fully effective, however, it is important that Project Risk Management is not\\nviewed as an optional process or performed as an additional overhead task. Since many elements of project\\nmanagement address inherent uncertainty, the interface between structured Project Risk Management and the\\nother processes of project management needs to be clear. The outputs of Project Risk Management should be\\ntaken into account within many of the project management processes. They can, for example, impact:\\n• Estimating resource requirements, cost, or duration;\\n• Assessing the impact of proposed scope changes;\\n• Planning or re-planning the forward strategy of the project;\\n• Allocating resources to tasks; and\\n• Reporting progress to stakeholders.\\nN one of these actions can be performed properly without a clear view of the risk involved, as determined\\nduring the Project Risk Management process. In other words, project management process effectiveness is\\nincreased by using the information and results from Project Risk Management.\\nI n addition, effective Project Risk Management requires input from other project management processes.\\nOutputs such as the work breakdown structure (WBS), estimates, the project schedule, assumptions list, etc.\\nare all important prerequisites for effective Project Risk Management.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 26: '3\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\n3.2 Project Risk Management Processes\\nThe defi ned steps of Project Risk Management describe a structured approach for understanding and\\nmanaging risk on a project. This chapter outlines the steps required for effective Project Risk Management.\\nEach step is described in more detail in subsequent chapters.\\nAs previously defi ned, project risk is an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or\\nnegative effect on a project’s objectives. From this defi nition, it is clear that risks only exist in relation to\\nobjectives. It is therefore essential at the start of the Project Risk Management process to clearly defi ne the\\nobjectives. It is also clear that different projects are exposed to different levels of risk, so each step in the\\nProject Risk Management process should be scalable to meet the varying degrees of risk. Scalable elements\\nof the process include:\\n• Available resources,\\n• Methodology and processes used,\\n• Tools and techniques used,\\n• Supporting infrastructure,\\n• Review and update frequency, and\\n• Reporting requirements.\\nAs a precondition for a successful Project Risk Management implementation, it is important to have a clear\\nunderstanding of the risk thresholds that defi ne the key stakeholders’ views on acceptable levels of risk, as\\nwell as a framework against which identifi ed risks can be assessed.\\nA s a result, the Project Risk Management process always starts with an initiation step. This is required in\\norder to ensure a common understanding and agreement of the team and other stakeholders on the approach\\nand parameters that will be applied in managing risk in this project, as well as the scope and objectives of the\\nProject Risk Management process itself. Project Risk Management activities, resources, and attention should\\nbe appropriate to the project since different projects warrant different levels of risk management application.\\nThe main actions to provide the required tailoring are as follows:\\n• Defi ne those objectives against which risks will be identifi ed,\\n• Defi ne how the elements of the Project Risk Management process will be scaled for this\\nproject, and\\n• Defi ne risk thresholds, tolerances, and the assessment framework.\\nT he outputs from this initial step should be documented, communicated, and then reviewed by the\\nstakeholders to ensure a common understanding of the scope and objectives for the Project Risk Management\\nprocess. The document should be formally approved at a senior level.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n14',\n",
       " 27: '3\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\nO nce the Project Risk Management scope and objectives are agreed upon, it is possible to start identifying\\nrisks, being careful to distinguish genuine risks from non-risks (such as causes, effects, problems, issues etc.).\\nA variety of risk identifi cation techniques is available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. One or\\nmore techniques should be selected as appropriate for meeting the needs of the specifi c project. The aim is\\nto expose and document all knowable risks, recognizing that some risks will be inherently unknowable and\\nothers will emerge later in the project. The emergent nature of risk requires the Project Risk Management\\nprocess to be iterative, repeating the Identify Risks process in order to fi nd risks which were not evident earlier\\nin the project. Input should be sought from a wide range of project stakeholders when identifying risks, since\\neach will have a different perspective on the risks facing the project. Historical records and project documents\\nshould also be reviewed to identify risks for this project.\\nAll identifi ed risks are recorded. Ideally, a risk owner is designated for each identifi ed risk. It is the\\nresponsibility of the risk owner to manage the corresponding risk through all of the subsequent Project Risk\\nManagement processes.\\nFollowing risk identifi cation, it is necessary to evaluate the importance of each risk, in order to prioritize\\nindividual risks for further attention, evaluate the level of overall project risk, and determine appropriate\\nresponses. Risk evaluation can be performed using qualitative techniques to address individual risks, using\\nquantitative techniques to consider the overall effect of risk on the project outcome, or using both in combination.\\nThese two approaches require different types of data, but where both qualitative and quantitative techniques\\nare used, an integrated approach should be adopted.\\nQualitative techniques are used to gain a better understanding of individual risks, considering a range\\nof characteristics such as probability of occurrence, degree of impact on project objectives, manageability,\\ntiming of possible impacts, relationships with other risks, common causes or effects, etc. Understanding and\\nprioritizing risks is an essential prerequisite to managing them, so qualitative techniques are used on most\\nprojects. The outputs from qualitative assessments should be documented and communicated to key project\\nstakeholders and form a basis for determining appropriate responses.\\nQ uantitative techniques provide insights into the combined effect of identifi ed risks on the project outcome.\\nThese techniques take into account probabilistic or project-wide effects, such as correlation between risks,\\ninterdependency, and feedback loops, thereby indicating the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The\\nresult is an indication of the degree of overall risk faced by the project. The results of quantitative analysis\\nshould be used to focus the development of appropriate responses, particularly the calculation of required\\ncontingency reserve levels, and must be documented and communicated to inform subsequent actions.\\nQuantitative techniques may not be required for all projects to ensure effective management of risk.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n15',\n",
       " 28: '3\\nCHAPTER 3 − INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESSES\\nO nce individual risks have been prioritized and the degree of overall project risk exposure is understood,\\nappropriate risk responses should be developed using an iterative process which continues until an optimal\\nset of responses has been developed. A range of possible response strategies exists for both threats and\\nopportunities. The risk owner should select a suitable strategy for each individual risk, based on its characteristics\\nand assessed priority, ensuring that the strategy is achievable, affordable, cost effective, and appropriate. The\\nuse of a single strategy that addresses several related risks should be considered whenever possible. The risk\\nowner is responsible for defi ning actions to implement the chosen strategy. These actions may be delegated to\\naction owners as appropriate. The risk owner should monitor actions to determine their effectiveness, and also\\nto identify any secondary risks which may arise because of the implementation of risk responses. In addition\\nto individual risk responses, actions may be taken to respond to overall project risk. All response strategies\\nand actions should be documented and communicated to key project stakeholders and incorporated into the\\nproject plan.\\nI t is essential that agreed-upon actions are implemented; otherwise the risk exposure of the project remains\\nunchanged. It is also vital that the Project Risk Management process be repeated at regular intervals throughout\\nthe life of the project. This will enable the project team to reevaluate the status of previously identifi ed risks,\\nto identify emergent and secondary risks, and to determine the effectiveness of the Project Risk Management\\nprocess.\\nThe steps outlined previously form the Project Risk Management process. These are detailed in subsequent\\nchapters, as follows:\\n• Plan Risk Management (Chapter 4) — Defi nes the scope and objectives of the Project Risk\\nManagement process, and ensures that the risk process is fully integrated into wider project\\nmanagement.\\n• Identify Risks (Chapter 5) — Identifi es as many knowable risks as practicable.\\n• Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 6) — Evaluates key characteristics of individual risks\\nenabling them to be prioritized for further action.\\n• Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis (Chapter 7) — Evaluates the combined effect of risks on the\\noverall project outcome.\\n• Plan Risk Responses (Chapter 8) — Determines appropriate response strategies and actions for\\neach individual risk and for overall project risk, and integrates them into a consolidated project\\nmanagement plan.\\n• Monitor and Control Risks (Chapter 9) — Implements agreed-upon actions, reviews changes in\\nproject risk exposure, identifi es additional risk management actions as required, and assesses the\\neffectiveness of the Project Risk Management process.\\nF igure 3-1 shows the fl ow of control and information between the various steps within the Project Risk\\nManagement process.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 31: '4\\nCHAPTER 4\\nPLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n4.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Plan Risk Management Process\\nT he objectives of the Plan Risk Management process are to develop the overall risk management strategy\\nfor the project, to decide how the risk management processes will be executed, and to integrate Project Risk\\nManagement with all other project management activities.\\nE ffective risk management requires creation of a risk management plan. This plan describes how the\\nrisk management processes should be carried out and how they fi t in with the other project management\\nprocesses. On a broader level, it describes the relationships among Project Risk Management, general project\\nmanagement, and the management processes in the rest of the organization. To provide the greatest benefi t,\\ninitial risk management planning should be carried out early in the overall planning of the project, and the\\ncorresponding risk management activities integrated into the overall project management plan. The risk\\nmanagement plan may subsequently need to be adapted as the needs of the project and its stakeholders\\nbecome clearer or change.\\nAlthough the Project Risk Management processes form an integral part of the overall project management\\nplan, a budget in terms of resources, cost, and time for the specifi c risk management activities should be\\nestablished in order to better track, control, and, as necessary, defend the corresponding expenditures\\nthroughout the project. The cost of treating the risks themselves should be included appropriately in the project\\nbudget, while the risk management plan should describe how this part of the project budget is evaluated,\\nallocated, and managed. The risk management plan will defi ne the monitoring methods to ensure that the\\ncorresponding expenditures are tracked appropriately, as well as the conditions under which the approved\\nbudget for risk management can be modifi ed.\\nIn the same way that project management is a process of progressive elaboration, risk management\\nactivities need to be repeated throughout the project. The risk management plan should defi ne both the\\nnormal frequency for repeating the processes as well as specifi c or exceptional conditions under which the\\ncorresponding actions should be initiated. The corresponding risk management activities should be integrated\\ninto the project management plan.\\nThere are two categories of success criteria for risk management: those for success of the project in\\ngeneral, and those for success of Project Risk Management.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n19',\n",
       " 32: '4\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\n• Project-Related Criteria. To assess the success of Project Risk Management, the stakeholders\\nmust agree on an acceptable level of results for the project-related criteria (such as cost, time, and\\nscope). In order to ensure consistency and agreement among stakeholders, the risk management\\nplan should present these objectives with reference to the project defi nition documents. To provide\\nguidance in risk management, particularly in prioritizing risk responses, stakeholders should also\\nprioritize each project objective.\\n• Process-Related Criteria. The measures for success in Project Risk Management depend on a\\nnumber of factors, such as the inherent level of uncertainty of the project. For example, the Project\\nRisk Management process for a research project needs to address more unforeseen changes than\\nfor a project with a more predictable environment. A research Project Risk Management process\\nmay be considered a success even if it results in more variance from the baseline than would be\\nallowable for a successful process in a more predictable project.\\nT he level of risk that is considered acceptable in a project depends on the risk attitudes of the relevant\\nstakeholders. The risk attitudes of both the organization and the stakeholders may be infl uenced by a number\\nof factors, all of which need to be identifi ed. These include their inherent tolerance for uncertainty, and the\\nrelative importance to them of achieving or missing specifi c project objectives. The output of this analysis\\nshould then be taken into account for setting thresholds and providing weighting factors when applying the\\nProject Risk Management processes in the specifi c project.\\nGuidelines and rules for escalating risk-related information to management and other stakeholders should\\nrefl ect the risk attitudes and expectations of the corresponding stakeholders. The project manager should\\nmaintain effective communication with the stakeholders as the project evolves, in order to become aware of\\nany changes in the stakeholders’ attitudes and adapt the risk management approach to take any new facts\\ninto account.\\nIt is important that the participants share a common understanding of all terms used to describe the risks,\\nand that the critical values and thresholds that will serve as parameters for the tools should be defi ned in a\\nmanner consistent with the scope of the project and the attitudes of the stakeholders. If qualitative analysis\\nuses such terms as “high impact” or “medium probability,” these should be defi ned objectively in the risk\\nmanagement plan. Similarly, the risk management plan should specify any key numerical values required in\\nquantitative analysis or for decision-making in risk response planning or risk monitoring and control.\\nR isk management planning should establish the type and level of risk detail to be addressed and provide a\\ntemplate of the risk register that will be used for recording risk-related information. The risk management plan\\nshould also indicate the intensity of effort and the frequency with which the various Project Risk Management\\nprocesses should be applied; this depends on the characteristics of the project as well as on the specifi ed risk\\nmanagement objectives.\\nI n order for the Project Risk Management processes to be carried out correctly and effectively, the project\\nteam and other stakeholders need to know where and when they will be expected to participate, their criteria\\nfor determining success, their level of authority, and what action to take relative to actions or decisions beyond\\nthis level. The risk management plan specifi es the project’s risk management roles and responsibilities and\\ndefi nes the corresponding expectations for both senior management and project personnel.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n20',\n",
       " 33: '4\\nCHAPTER 4 − PLAN RISK MANAGEMENT\\nR isk-related communication occurs at two levels: (a) within the project team, and (b) between the project\\nteam and the other project stakeholders. The principles for each of these categories of communication are\\ndefi ned in the risk management plan. For the team, the plan describes the frequency and scope of the various\\nrisk management meetings and reports required to carry out the corresponding Project Risk Management\\nprocesses as well as the structure and content of such meetings and reports. For the other stakeholders, the\\nplan sets their expectations as to the structure, content, and frequency of routine documents to be received\\nas well as the way in which information will be shared for escalation or exceptional events. Details of the\\ninformation required by the project team from stakeholders should also be clearly defi ned.\\n4.2 Critical Success Factors for the Plan Risk Management Process\\nT he principal criteria for a valid risk management plan are acceptance by the stakeholders, alignment\\nwith the internal and external constraints on the project, balance between cost or effort and benefi t, and\\ncompleteness with respect to the needs of the Project Risk Management process. Critical success factors for\\nthe Plan Risk Management process are detailed below.\\n4.2.1 Identify and Address Barriers to Successful Project Risk Management\\nThe time and effort required to carry out the Plan Risk Management process will not be supported unless\\nthe stakeholders, and especially management in the organization responsible for the project, recognize and\\naccept the benefi ts of managing risk, and the added value of addressing this as a skill in its own right rather\\nthan as a passive or reactive component of general project management.\\nA clear defi nition of the project objectives and a high-level view of the project environment and solution\\napproach are required to provide a valid basis for risk management. The project manager should therefore\\nensure that valid defi nition and planning information is available for the plan risk management activity.\\nA n organization inexperienced in risk management planning may need to develop its own approach and\\nmay expend an inappropriate amount of time and effort on this. Alternatively it may use a proprietary or\\npre-existing approach which requires tailoring. The availability of some or all of the following organizational\\nprocess assets contributes to the chances of success of the Plan Risk Management activities: standard\\ntemplates, predefi ned risk categories, and an established project management methodology incorporating\\nrisk management procedures that specify what risk information is required for decision making, when it is\\nrequired, and a defi nition of concepts and terms, roles, responsibilities, and authority levels. Access to relevant\\nlessons learned at this stage will allow this experience to be taken into account from the start of the project.\\nThe risk management plan will not deliver its value unless Project Risk Management is carried out as\\nan integral part of the project. The corresponding activities should be built into the project work breakdown\\nstructure and included in the corresponding schedule, budget, and work-assignment documents.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Management should be involved in the analysis of the level of\\nresourcing required for managing project risk and accept the risks that may arise from specifi c limitations\\nplaced on the provision of resources. Disagreements between stakeholders in the areas of risk tolerance and\\nevaluation measures should be addressed and resolved.\\n4.2.3 Comply with the Organization’s Objectives, Policies, and Practices\\nThe feasibility of risk management planning is dependent upon the features of the organization in which\\nit is carried out. The rules and guidelines defi ned in the risk management plan should be compatible with the\\nculture of the organization, its capabilities from the point of view of people and facilities, and its values, goals,\\nand objectives.\\nP roject management in general, and risk management in particular, contribute to the organization’s effective\\ngovernance.

Consequently, after risk management planning has\\nbeen completed, the fi rst process in the iterative Project Risk Management process aims to identify all the\\nknowable risks to project objectives.\\nI t is, however, impossible to identify all the risks at the outset of a project. Over time, the level of project\\nrisk exposure changes as a result of the decisions and actions taken previously in the project (internal change)\\nand of externally imposed change.\\nT he purpose of risk identifi cation is to identify risks to the maximum extent that is practicable. The fact that\\nsome risks are unknowable or emergent requires the Identify Risk process to be iterative, repeating the Identify\\nRisks process to fi nd new risks which have become knowable since the previous iteration of the process.\\nW hen a risk is fi rst identifi ed, potential responses may also be identifi ed at the same time. These should be\\nrecorded during the Identify Risks process and considered for immediate action if such action is appropriate.\\nWhere such responses are not implemented immediately, these should be considered during the Plan Risk\\nResponses process.\\n5.2 Critical Success Factors for the Identify Risks Process\\nThe practices described in Sections 5.2.1 through 5.2.10 will maximize the value and effectiveness of the\\nIdentify Risks process and enhance the likelihood of identifying as many risks as practicable.\\n5.2.1 Early Identifi cation\\nR isk identifi cation should be performed as early as possible in the project lifecycle, recognizing the paradox\\nthat uncertainty is high in the initial stages of a project so there is often less information on which to base the\\nrisk identifi cation. Early risk identifi cation enables key project decisions to take maximum account of risks\\ninherent in the project, and may result in changes to the project strategy. It also maximizes the time available\\nfor development and implementation of risk responses, which enhances effi ciency since responses taken early\\nare often normally less costly than later ones.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n25',\n",
       " 38: '5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n5.2.2 Iterative Identifi cation\\nSince not all risks can be identifi ed at any given point in the project, it is essential that risk identifi cation is\\nrepeated throughout the project life cycle. This should be done periodically, at a frequency determined during\\nthe Plan Risk Management process. Risk identifi cation might also be repeated at key milestones in the project,\\nor whenever there is signifi cant change to the project or its operating environment.\\n5.2.3 Emergent Identifi cation\\nIn addition to invoking the Identify Risks process as defi ned in the project plan, the Project Risk Management\\nprocess should permit risks to be identifi ed at any time, not limited to formal risk identifi cation events or\\nregular reviews.\\n5.2.4 Comprehensive Identifi cation\\nA broad range of sources of risk should be considered to ensure that as many uncertainties as possible that\\nmight affect objectives have been identifi ed.\\n5.2.5 Explicit Identifi cation of Opportunities\\nThe Identify Risks process should ensure opportunities are properly considered.\\n5.2.6 Multiple Perspectives\\nT he Identify Risks process should take input from a broad range of project stakeholders to ensure that\\nall perspectives are represented and considered. Limiting risk identifi cation to the immediate project team is\\nunlikely to expose all knowable risks.\\n5.2.7 Risks Linked to Project Objectives\\nE ach identifi ed project risk should relate to at least one project objective (time, cost, quality, scope, etc.),\\nnoting that the PMBOK ® G uide defi nes risk as an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive\\nor a negative effect on a project’s objectives. Consideration of each project objective during the Identify Risks\\nprocess will assist in identifying risks, noting that some risks may affect more than one objective.\\n5.2.8 Complete Risk Statement\\nI dentifi ed risks should be clearly and unambiguously described, so that they can be understood by those\\nresponsible for risk assessment and risk response planning. Single words or phrases such as “resources”\\nor “logistics” are inadequate and do not properly communicate the nature of the risk. More detailed risk\\ndescriptions are required which explicitly state the uncertainty and its causes and effects.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 39: '5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n5.2.9 Ownership and Level of Detail\\nR isks can be identifi ed at a number of levels of detail. A generalized or high-level description of risk can\\nmake it diffi cult to develop responses and assign ownership, while describing risks in a lot of detail can create\\na great deal of work. Each risk should be described at a level of detail at which it can be assigned to a single\\nrisk owner with clear responsibility and accountability for its management. Trigger conditions should also be\\nidentifi ed where this is possible and appropriate.\\n5.2.10 Objectivity\\nAll human activities are susceptible to bias, especially when dealing with uncertainty. Both motivational\\nbiases, where someone is trying to bias the result in one direction or another, or cognitive biases, where\\nbiases occur as people are using their best judgment and applying heuristics, may occur. This should be\\nexplicitly recognized and addressed during the Identify Risks process. Sources of bias should be exposed\\nwherever possible, and their effect on the risk process should be managed proactively. The aim is to minimize\\nsubjectivity, and allow open and honest identifi cation of as many risks as possible to the project.\\n5.3 Tools and Techniques for the Identify Risks Process\\nA range of tools and techniques is available for risk identifi cation. These fall into the following three\\ncategories, as illustrated in Figure 5-1:\\nFigure 5-1. Three Perspectives of Risk Identification\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 40: '5\\nCHAPTER 5 − IDENTIFY RISKS\\n5.3.1 Historical Review\\nHistorical reviews are based on what occurred in the past, either on this project, or other similar projects\\nin the same organization, or comparable projects in other organizations. Historical review approaches rely on\\ncareful selection of comparable situations which are genuinely similar to the current project, and fi ltering of\\ndata to ensure that only relevant previous risks are considered. In each case, the risks identifi ed in the selected\\nhistorical situation should be considered, asking whether they or similar risks might arise in this project.\\n5.3.2 Current Assessments\\nC urrent assessments rely on detailed consideration of the current project, analyzing its characteristics\\nagainst given frameworks and models in order to expose areas of uncertainty. Unlike historical review\\napproaches, current assessment techniques do not rely on outside reference points, but are based purely on\\nexamination of the project.\\n5.3.3 Creativity Techniques\\nA wide range of creativity techniques can be used for risk identifi cation, which encourages project\\nstakeholders to use their imagination to fi nd risks which might affect the project. The outcomes or effectiveness\\nof these techniques depend on the ability of participants to think creatively. These techniques can be used\\neither singly or in groups, and employ varying degrees of structure. These techniques depend on the ability of\\nparticipants to think creatively, and their success is enhanced by use of a skilled facilitator.\\nE ach category of risk identifi cation technique has strengths and weaknesses, and no single technique\\ncan be expected to reveal all knowable risks. Consequently, the Identify Risks process for a particular project\\nshould use a combination of techniques, perhaps selecting one from each category. For example, a project may\\nchoose to use a risk identifi cation checklist (historical review), together with assumptions analysis (current\\nassessment) and brainstorming (creativity).\\nUse of a risk breakdown structure which organizes the categories of potential risks on the project, a prompt\\nlist, or a set of generic list categories may assist in ensuring that as many sources of risk as practicable have\\nbeen addressed, while recognizing that no such tools are complete nor can they replace original thinking.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Use of structured risk descriptions can ensure clarity. Risk meta-language offers a useful\\nway of distinguishing a risk from its cause(s) and effect(s), describing each risk using three-part statements in\\nthe form: “As a result of cause, risk may occur, which would lead to effect.” The relationship between cause,\\nrisk, and effect is shown in Figure 5-2.\\nFigure 5-2.

As such it does not directly address the overall\\nrisk to project objectives that results from the combined effect of all risks and their potential interactions with\\neach other. This can however be achieved through use of quantitative risk analysis techniques (see Chapter 7).\\nOne step in the analysis is to categorize risks according to their sources or causes. If several risks arise\\nfrom a common source, sometimes called a root cause, risk responses may be more effective when they focus\\non addressing this root cause.\\nI dentifying common effects from groups of risks allows identifi cation of the areas of greatest risk exposure\\n(e.g. to the project completion date, the budget, or a particular deliverable’s scope), facilitating risk response\\nfocus in these areas.\\nThe methods of qualitative risk analysis are applied to the list of risks created or updated by the Identify\\nRisks process to provide project management with the characteristics of the risks that have the most infl uence\\n(positive or negative) on achieving the project’s objectives. Risks that are assessed as high priority to either\\nthreaten or to enhance the achievement of project objectives will be an important focus in the Plan Risk\\nResponses process. They may be further analyzed, such as in the analysis of the overall project risk that is\\ndiscussed in Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.\\n6.2 Critical Success Factors for the Perform Qualitative Risk\\nAnalysis Process\\nSeveral factors that lead to successful qualitative risk analysis are described in Sections 6.2.1 through\\n6.2.4, and summarized in Figure 6-1. Agreement of the project stakeholders is a fundamental criterion and\\na common theme. The agreed-upon approach is the foundation of process credibility. Then, agreed-upon\\ndefi nitions enable high-quality information to be collected. Finally, with these conditions in place, the process\\ncan be executed reliably, which contributes to the credibility of its outputs.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Building Risk Analysis Credibility\\n6.2.1 Use Agreed-Upon Approach\\nT he process is based on an agreed-upon approach to this assessment that is applied across all of the\\nidentifi ed risks in any project. By the nature of project risk, all risks may be assessed according to probability\\nof occurrence and impact on individual objectives should the risk occur. Other factors may be considered in\\ndetermining the importance of a risk as follows:\\n• Urgency (proximity). Risks requiring near term responses may be considered more urgent to\\naddress. Indicators of urgency can include the lead time necessary to execute a risk response and the\\nclarity of symptoms and warning signs (also known as detectability) that may trigger the response.\\n• Manageability. Some risks are not manageable and it would be a waste of resources to attempt to\\naddress them. The project team may examine these and decide to:\\n○ Go forward, perhaps establishing a contingency reserve.\\n○ Stop or re-scope the project because these risks pose an unmanageable threat or an\\nopportunity that should not be missed with high probability and consequences.\\n○ Inform the customer of the risks and ask for a decision from their point of view.\\n• I mpact external to the project. A risk may increase in importance if it affects the enterprise beyond\\nthe project.\\n6.2.2 Use Agreed-Upon Defi nitions of Risk Terms\\nT he risk assessment should be based on agreed-upon defi nitions of important terms, and those defi nitions\\nshould be used consistently when assessing each risk. The use of defi nitions, for example, of levels of probability\\nand of impact on objectives, assists the providers of the information in giving realistic assessments for each\\nrisk, and facilitates the communication of the results to management and other stakeholders.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Often this information is not available in any\\nhistoric database and should be gathered by interviews, workshops, and other means using expert judgment. Data\\ngathered from individuals may be subject to reporting or intentional bias. When this occurs, the bias should be\\nidentifi ed and remedied where possible, or a different, unbiased source of information should be found and used.\\n6.2.4 Perform Iterative Qualitative Risk Analysis\\nT he success of qualitative risk analysis is enhanced if the process is used periodically throughout the project. It\\nis impossible to know in advance all the risks that may occur in a project, therefore the Identify Risks and Perform\\nQualitative Analysis processes should be repeated periodically for individual risks.

Output from qualitative risk analysis tools includes\\na listing of risks in priority order or in priority groups (e.g., high, moderate, and low).\\nT he tools for qualitative risk analysis allow the organization or project stakeholders to specify those levels\\nor combinations of risk characteristics that make a particular risk of interest to management. Most tools assess\\na risk’s importance from a combination of probability of occurrence and degree of impact on objectives.\\n6.3.2 Collect and Analyze Data\\nA ssessment of individual risks is based on information collected about them. Therefore, data collection\\nand evaluation tools, including interviews, workshops, and references to databases of prior projects, require\\nmanagement support and attention. It is important to protect against bias in data gathering, which is important\\nwhen relying on expert judgment for the information.\\n6.3.3 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Specifi c Objectives\\nS ome tools permit distinguishing a risk’s priority in terms of the affected objective. This capability provides\\na list of risks that are important for any specifi c objective of interest to management. This is useful since it is\\ncommon for risks to have uneven impacts on various project objectives.\\n6.3.4 Prioritize Risks by Probability and Impact on Overall Project\\nThere are reasons for constructing a measure of a specifi c risk’s importance to the entire project as\\ncontrasted with its importance to specifi c objectives. A common reason is for ease of communication with\\nmanagement and other stakeholders. When a single risk prioritization index is needed, the organization should\\nbe explicit about how that index is created. Usually the index refl ects the organization’s preference among\\nobjectives. The technique for creating the overall risk priority measure should be documented in the Plan Risk\\nManagement process.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

Understanding the relationships between risks may provide a better\\nunderstanding of the possibility and magnitude of project risk than if risks are only considered as separate\\nand independent events. Identifying common root causes of a group of risks, for instance, may reveal both the\\nmagnitude of the risk event for the group as a whole along with effective strategies that might address several\\nrisks simultaneously. Alternatively, some risks may be linked with others in a causal chain, and understanding\\nthe chain of risks may lead to a better understanding of the implication of risk for the project. Identifying risks\\nthat can occur at the same time or using the same resources for recovery might provide a realistic picture of\\nproblems of risk mitigation using scarce resources.\\nCombining the results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process with the risk breakdown structure\\n(see Identify Risks, Chapter 5) can show clusters of priority risks arising from specifi c sources. A combination\\nof the risk analysis information with the work breakdown structure (WBS) can show which areas of the project\\nexhibit the most risk. Assessing the high-priority risks’ impact on one objective, such as the schedule, may\\nindicate which activities to address to reduce that objective’s uncertainty. All of these approaches can contribute\\nto the realism and usefulness of the qualitative risk analysis.\\n6.3.6 Document the Results of the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis Process\\nT he Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process adds structure to the list of undifferentiated risks (see Identify\\nRisks, Chapter 5) into categories of priority. Priorities are usually based on the risk’s probability of occurring\\nand its potential impact on specifi c project objectives or on the whole project. Each identifi ed risk is assigned\\na priority, perhaps by objective or for the entire project. This information is usually stored in the risk register\\nwhich is easy to use and update with new information. The risk register list of prioritized risks is posted to the\\nproject participants who are responsible for further analysis or action to improve the project plan. Risks that\\nare judged to have high priority are segregated for further analysis and response planning and are generally\\nmonitored frequently. Risks of low priority to the project may be placed on a watch list and are reviewed less\\noften for changes in their status.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

However it should be recognized that quantitative risk analysis is not always required or appropriate\\nfor all projects. For example, qualitative risk analysis may provide enough information for development of\\neffective risk responses, especially for smaller projects. Therefore, during the Plan Risk Management process,\\nthe benefi ts of quantitative risk analysis should be weighed against the effort required to ensure that the\\nadditional insights and value justify the additional effort.\\nP artial risk analyses, such as qualitative risk analysis, aim at prioritizing individual risks viewed one at a time\\nand therefore cannot produce measures of overall project risk when all risks are considered simultaneously.\\nCalculating estimates of overall project risk is the focus of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process.\\nS pecifi c project risks are usually best understood and quantifi ed at a detailed level such as the line-item\\ncost or schedule activity level. By contrast, project objectives such as achievement of the project’s budget or\\nthe schedule are specifi ed at a higher level, often at the level of the total project. An overall risk analysis, such\\nas one that uses quantitative techniques, estimates the implication of all quantifi ed risks on project objectives.\\nThe implementation of overall risk analysis using quantitative methods requires:\\n• Complete and accurate representation of the project objectives built up from individual project\\nelements. Examples of these representations include the project schedule or cost estimate.\\n• Identifying risks on individual project elements such as schedule activities or line-item costs at a\\nlevel of detail that lends itself to specifi c assessment of individual risks.\\n• Including generic risks that have a broader effect than individual project elements.\\n• Applying a quantitative method (such as Monte Carlo simulation or decision tree analysis) that incorporates\\nmultiple risks simultaneously in determining overall impact on the overall project objective.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

In risk analysis of cost and schedule, for example, an appropriate\\nmethod is Monte Carlo simulation. A decision tree is an appropriate method for making decisions when future\\nevents are not certain, using the probability and impact of all risks, and combining their effect to derive an\\noverall project measure such as value or cost.

This possibility is sometimes addressed by correlating the risks that are related, ensuring that\\nthey generally occur together during the analysis. Another common way to represent the risks which occur\\ntogether is by using the risk register listing of the risk or root cause and attaching it to several project\\nelements such as schedule activities or cost elements. When a particular risk occurs, the affected elements\\nwill all experience the effect of that risk together.\\n7.3 Tools and Techniques for the Perform Quantitative Risk\\nAnalysis Process\\nT ools and techniques used appropriately for quantitative risk analysis have several characteristics, as\\nfollows:\\n7.3.1 Comprehensive Risk Representation\\nRisk models permit representation of many, if not all, of the risks that have impact on an objective\\nsimultaneously. They also permit the representation of both opportunities and threats to the project’s\\nobjectives.\\n7.3.2 Risk Impact Calculation\\nQ uantitative models facilitate the correct calculation of the effect of many risks, which are typically identifi ed\\nand quantifi ed at a level of detail below the total project, on the project objectives, which are typically described\\nat the level of the total project.\\n7.3.3 Quantitative Method Appropriate to Analyzing Uncertainty\\nProbability models use a quantitative method that addresses uncertainty. Specifi cally, the methods should\\nbe able to handle the way uncertainty is represented, predominantly as probability of an event’s occurring or as\\nprobability distributions for a range of outcomes.

There is also a need during the Plan Risk\\nResponses process to consider the risks aggregated during the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process\\n(e.g., ten small, related risks combined may pose a big risk to the project), and then to develop generic\\nresponses where possible. Another interaction effect that may occur is when one risk, if it occurs, may affect\\nthe probability or impact of other risks.\\nDeciding on the response strategy may require a compromise, since some proposed responses may be\\nmutually exclusive or counterproductive.

Any proposed risk response plan needs to be assessed against the following criteria:\\n(cid:129) Consistency with organizational values, project objectives, and stakeholder expectations;\\n(cid:129) Technical feasibility;\\n(cid:129) Ability of the project team or risk action owners outside the project to carry out the corresponding\\nactions; and\\n(cid:129) Balance between overall impact of the response on the project objectives and the improvement in\\nthe risk profi le of the project.\\n8.2.7 Address Both Threats and Opportunities\\nRisk response planning should combine responses that address the threats as well as those that provide\\nfor opportunities into a single, integrated plan. If either threats or opportunities are not fully addressed, the\\ncombined set of response strategies will be incomplete and may even be invalid.\\n8.2.8 Develop Strategies before Tactical Responses\\nRisk response planning should be carried out in an open-minded manner rather than adopting the fi rst\\nresponse that seems to be feasible. The responses should be planned at a general, strategic level and the\\nstrategy validated and agreed upon, prior to developing the detailed tactical approach.\\nOnce the responses have been planned at a strategic level, they should be expanded into actions at the tactical\\nlevel and integrated into the project management plan (e.g., schedule, budget, and resource assignments). This\\nactivity may generate additional secondary risks, which will need to be addressed at this time.\\n8.3 Risk Response Strategies\\nT he project manager should develop risk response strategies for individual risks, sets of risks, and project-\\nlevel risks. An overview of the steps in arriving at a complete set of responses is given in Figure 8-2.\\nT he affected stakeholders should be involved in determining the strategies. Once the strategies have been\\nselected, they need to be agreed upon by the entity that approves those strategies. There are four strategies\\nwhich address individual risks for threats and opportunities as described in Sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.4 (see\\nalso Fig. 8-2).\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n46',\n",
       " 59: '8\\nCHAPTER 8 − PLAN RISK RESPONSES\\n8.3.1 Avoid a Threat or Exploit an Opportunity\\nT his strategy involves taking the actions required to address a threat or an opportunity in order to ensure\\neither that the threat cannot occur or can have no effect on the project, or that the opportunity will occur and\\nthe project will be able to take advantage of it.\\n8.3.2 Transfer a Threat or Share an Opportunity\\nThis strategy entails transference to a third party that is better positioned to address a particular threat or\\nopportunity.\\n8.3.3 Mitigate a Threat or Enhance an Opportunity\\nM itigation and enhancement are the most widely applicable and widely used response strategies. Here, the\\napproach is to identify actions that will decrease the probability and/or the impact of a threat, and increase the\\nprobability and/or the impact of an opportunity.\\n8.3.4 Accept a Threat or an Opportunity\\nThis strategy applies when the other strategies are not considered applicable or feasible. Acceptance entails\\ntaking no action unless the risk actually occurs, in which case contingency or fallback plans may be developed\\nahead of time, to be implemented if the risk presents itself.\\n8.3.5 Applying Risk Response Strategies to Overall Project Risk\\nIn addition to responding to individual risks, the four risk response strategies can be applied to address\\noverall project risk as follows:\\n(cid:129) Cancel the project, as a last resort, if the overall level of risk remains unacceptable.\\n(cid:129) Set up a business structure in which the customer and the supplier share the risk.\\n(cid:129) Re-plan the project or change the scope and boundaries of the project, for example, by modifying the\\nproject priority, resource allocations, delivery calendar, etc.\\n(cid:129) Pursue the project despite a risk exposure that exceeds the desired level.\\n8.4 Tools and Techniques for the Plan Risk Responses Process\\nThere are four categories of tools and techniques, as follows:\\n(cid:129) Creativity tools to identify potential responses,\\n(cid:129) Decision-support tools for determining the optimal potential response.\\n(cid:129) Strategy implementation techniques designed to turn a strategy into action, and\\n(cid:129) Tools to transfer control to the Monitor and Control Risks process.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

The steps\\ninvolved in planning risk responses are shown in Figure 8.2.\\n8.4.1 Response Identifi cation\\nRisk response planning builds on the available information about the potential risks and aims to determine\\nthe optimal set of responses. For this reason, it should involve subject matter experts and employ creativity\\ntechniques in order to explore all of the options. Project planning and execution techniques are then required\\nto evaluate the potential effects of the various options on the project’s objectives.\\n8.4.2 Response Selection\\nOnce the set of potential responses for the risks being addressed is established, decision-support techniques\\nmay need to be applied to select the best possible subset from these responses. The selection process should\\ntake into account the cost of the responses, the impact on the project objectives, uncertainty of outcomes and\\nthe possible secondary and residual risks. The Identify Risks, Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis, and Plan Risk\\nResponses processes may then need to be applied to the resultant project management plan and the residual\\nand secondary risks that it would entail. This iterative approach continues until all of the individual risks are\\ndeemed acceptable and the overall risk is within a predefi ned threshold.\\n8.4.3 Action Planning\\nProject planning tools are used to turn the chosen strategies into concrete actions and to integrate these into\\nexisting plans. The corresponding actions may be unconditional (i.e., integrated into the project management\\nplan) or contingent on a trigger condition and predefi ned as a contingency response strategy.\\n8.4.4 Ownership and Responsibility Assignment\\nT he project manager needs to use resource assignment processes to ensure the availability of an owner for\\neach risk and for each response action, so that each associated risk is managed and each corresponding risk\\nresponse is carried out in a timely and effective manner.\\nTo enable risk monitoring to identify the imminence or actual occurrence of the corresponding event, every\\ncontingency response strategy should include a set of trigger conditions. The responsibility for monitoring\\nthese conditions should be clearly assigned in the Plan Risk Responses process and managed in the Monitor\\nand Control Risks process.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

The corresponding risk response information is often referred\\nto as the risk response plan, although it may in fact be an integral part of the risk register.\\n8.5.1 Add Risk Responses to the Risk Register\\nT he response-related information for each risk is recorded in the risk register and updated regularly. Any\\ninterested stakeholder should be able to rapidly access all the information required to verify their responsibilities\\nand manage the risk in accordance with the risk response plan. The set of residual risks and their priorities\\nare clearly identifi ed and recorded.\\n8.5.2 Add Corresponding Risk Responses to the Project Management Plan\\nW hile developing the detailed set of risk responses, the project-related implications are evaluated for\\ninclusion in a modifi ed project management plan. These include costs, resource assignments, scheduling\\ndetails, and changes to project documentation. Until these changes are formally approved along with the\\nadditional risks that they may carry, risk response planning cannot be considered complete.\\n8.5.3 Review and Document Predicted Exposure\\nO nce the risk responses have been defi ned and integrated into the project management plan, the individual\\nand overall residual risks related to this plan are evaluated in order to determine whether additional response\\nplanning is required, as shown in Figure 8-2.

If this is carried out correctly, the\\ninvested effort will be rewarded and future projects will benefi t from this project’s experience.\\n9.1 Purpose and Objectives of the Monitor and Control Risks Process\\nT he primary objectives of risk monitoring and controlling are to track identifi ed risks, monitor residual risks,\\nidentify new risks, ensure that risk response plans are executed at the appropriate time, and evaluate their\\neffectiveness throughout the project life cycle.\\nI n addition to tracking and managing the risk response actions, the effectiveness of all of the Project\\nRisk Management processes should be reviewed to provide improvements to the management of the current\\nproject as well as future ones.\\nF or each risk or set of risks for which a contingent response has been defi ned, the corresponding set of\\ntrigger conditions should have been specifi ed. It is the responsibility of the action owner to ensure that these\\nconditions are effectively monitored and that the corresponding actions are carried out as defi ned, in a timely\\nmanner.\\nOnce the Plan Risk Responses process is complete, all of the approved unconditional response actions\\nshould have been included and defi ned in the current project management plan. The fi rst action of risk\\nmonitoring and controlling is to check whether this is the case and take any appropriate action if necessary,\\nsuch as invoking the change management process with respect to any missing actions. This will then ensure\\nthat the agreed-upon actions are carried out within the normal project execution framework.\\nThe risk owners and risk action owners need to be briefed on any changes that may affect their\\nresponsibilities. Effective communication needs to be maintained between them and the project manager so\\nthat the designated stakeholders accept accountability for controlling the potential outcomes of specifi c risks,\\napply their best efforts to track the associated trigger conditions and carry out the agreed-upon responses in\\na timely manner.\\nI n addition to the response actions and trigger conditions, a mechanism for measuring the effectiveness\\nof the response is provided by the Plan Risk Responses process. The risk action owner should keep the risk\\nowner aware of the status of the response actions so that the risk owner can decide when the risk has been\\neffectively dealt with, or whether additional actions need to be planned and implemented.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 64: '9\\nCHAPTER 9 − MONITOR AND CONTROL RISKS\\nAs the project progresses, additional information becomes available and the project environment may\\nchange as some risks occur, whether foreseen or unforeseen, and others become or cease to be relevant.\\nThe planning should therefore be kept current and the project manager should ensure that periodic risk\\nreassessment, including risk identifi cation, analysis, and response planning, is repeated at reasonable intervals,\\nor in response to project events—without generating excessive administrative overhead. Typical reasons for\\nrisk reassessment are:\\n• Occurrence of a major or unexpected risk,\\n• Need to analyze a complex change request,\\n• Phase end review,\\n• Project re-planning or major plan elaboration, and\\n• Periodic review to ensure that the information remains current.\\nI n the event of major organizational changes, risk management planning may need to be revisited prior to\\nreassessing the risks.\\nIn addition to the regular status reviews, periodic audits should be performed to determine strengths and\\nweaknesses in handling risks within the project. This should entail identifying any barriers to effectiveness or\\nkeys to success in risk management, recognition of which could lead to improvements in risk management of\\nthe current or future projects.\\nAt the end of the project, an integrated analysis of the risk management process should be carried out\\nwith a focus on long-term process improvements. This analysis consolidates the fi ndings of the periodic\\naudits to identify lessons that would be applicable in general to a large proportion of the organization’s\\nprojects in the future, such as appropriate levels of resources, adequate time for the analysis, use of tools,\\nlevel of detail, etc.\\nAt project closure, the project manager should ensure that a description has been given of the closure of\\nevery risk in the risk register, for example: (a) did not occur; (b) occurred and contingency plan invoked; or (c)\\noccurred and impact to the project scope (i.e., time, cost, and quality).\\nT he output of the audit of the risk management process should be consolidated with specifi c information\\nwith respect to the project’s experience of risks, and any generally applicable guidelines for the organization\\nshould be highlighted and potential actions proposed for applying them.

Sponsor feedback also\\nmotivates the project team by demonstrating senior-level interest in Project Risk Management.\\nS takeholders’ perception of the effectiveness of risk management is conditioned in part by the way in\\nwhich risks are handled as they occur, and by the number or characteristics of such events. It is therefore\\ncrucial, whenever a risk occurs, that information about the event, as well as the progress and effectiveness of\\nthe responses, be communicated at regular intervals and in an honest manner adapted to the needs of each\\nstakeholder. This should be supported by a well-executed communications plan.\\n9.3 Tools and Techniques for the Monitor and Control Risks Process\\nIn addition to standard project management monitoring and control capabilities, risk monitoring and\\ncontrolling requires a focus on the tools which will support its key success factors for tracking overall risk as\\nwell as individual risks.\\n9.3.1 Managing Contingency Reserves\\nReserves may have been allocated separately to cover time-related and cost-related risks.

The standard\\nrules of brainstorming are often modifi ed when the technique is applied to risk identifi cation. For example it\\nis common to structure the risk identifi cation brainstorm using risk categories or a risk breakdown structure.\\nSome evaluation of proposed risks is often included in a risk identifi cation brainstorm to remove non-risks.

The diagram then identifi es risks as those uncertain\\nevents which could result in occurrence of the impact. Care needs to be taken when using this technique for\\nrisk identifi cation to distinguish between risks (uncertain causes of the impact) and issues (certain causes of the\\nimpact). An example cause and effect (Ishikawa) diagram is shown below: the risk (effect) to be analyzed is “staff\\nleaving the project”; the main causes are Environment, Ambition, Career Prospects, Satisfaction, Remuneration.\\nFigure D2.

In the\\ndiagram shown below the risks that were initially identifi ed included rework, extra cost, schedule slips, low\\nteam morale, customer mistrust and repeated audits. An examination of the identifi ed risks lead to a common\\nroot cause, that later phases of the project were typically started before the earlier ones were suffi ciently\\nmature.

An example, assuming\\nthat a 5×5 Probability and Impact Matrix is desired, is shown in Figure D11 where the probability ranges are\\nmore tightly defi ned at low levels of probability.\\nExamples of impact level defi nitions are very project-specifi c.

Alternatively, the risk may be fl agged for extra analysis in order to\\nreduce the range of uncertainty to fi t within a single range.\\nA n example of impact level defi nitions is shown in Figure D11.

       " 121: 'GLOSSARY\\nAssumptions. Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, are considered to be true, real, or\\ncertain without proof or demonstration. Assumptions affect all aspects of project planning and are part of the\\nprogressive elaboration of the project. Project teams frequently identify, document, and validate assumptions\\nas part of their planning process. Assumptions generally involve a degree of risk.\\nBenefi t. Positive effect on a project objective arising from the occurrence of an opportunity.\\nBias. During information gathering about risk, the source of information exhibits a preference or an inclination\\nthat inhibits impartial judgment. Types of bias which commonly affect the risk process include cognitive and\\nmotivational bias.\\nCause. Events or circumstances which currently exist and which might give rise to risks.\\nConsequence. See im pact .\\nConstraint. The state, quality, or sense of being restricted to a given course of action or inaction. An applicable\\nrestriction or limitation, either internal or external to a project, which will affect the performance of the project\\nor a process.\\nContingency Reserve. The amount of funds, budget, or time needed above the estimate to reduce the risk of\\noverruns of project objectives to a level acceptable to the organization.\\nContingency Plan. A plan developed in anticipation of the occurrence of a risk, to be executed only if specifi c,\\npredetermined trigger conditions arise.\\nDecision Tree Analysis. The decision tree is a diagram that describes a decision under consideration and the\\nimplications of choosing one or another of the available alternatives. It is used when some future scenarios or\\noutcomes of actions are uncertain. It incorporates probabilities and the cost or rewards of each logical path of\\nevents and future decisions, and uses expected monetary value analysis to help the organization identify the\\nrelative values of alternative actions.\\nEffect. Conditional future events or conditions which would directly affect one or more project objectives if the\\nassociated risk happened.\\nEmergent Risk. A risk which arises later in a project and which could not have been identifi ed earlier on.\\nIdentify Risks. The process of determining which risks may affect the project and documenting their\\ncharacteristics.\\nImpact. A measure of the effect of a risk on one or more objectives if it occurs. Also known asc onsequence .\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n109',\n",
       " 122: 'GLOSSARY\\nIndividual Risk. A specifi c uncertain event or condition which, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on\\nat least one project objective.\\nIssue. See p roblem .\\nLikelihood. See p robability .\\nMonitor and Control Risks. The process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identifi ed risks, monitoring\\nresidual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the risk process throughout the project life cycle.\\nMonte Carlo Analysis. A technique that computes or iterates the project cost or project schedule many times\\nusing input values, selected at random from probability distributions of possible costs or durations, to calculate\\na distribution of possible total project cost or completion dates.\\nObjective. Something toward which work is to be directed, a strategic position to be attained or a purpose to\\nbe achieved, a result to be obtained, a product to be produced, or a service to be performed.\\nOpportunity. A condition or situation favorable to the project, a positive set of circumstances, a positive set\\nof events, a risk that will have a positive impact on project objectives, or a possibility for positive changes.\\nContrast with threat .\\nOverall Project Risk. Overall project risk represents the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Overall\\nproject risk is more than the sum of individual risks on a project, since it applies to the whole project rather\\nthan to individual elements or tasks. It represents the exposure of stakeholders to the implications of variations\\nin project outcome measured in terms of the corresponding objectives.\\nPerform Qualitative Risk Analysis. The process of prioritizing risks for further analysis or action by assessing\\nand combining their probability of occurrence and impact.\\nPerform Quantitative Risk Analysis. The process of numerically analyzing the effect of identifi ed risks on\\noverall project objectives.\\nPlan Risk Management. The process of defi ning how to conduct risk management activities for a project.\\nPlan Risk Responses. The process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce\\nthreats to project objectives.\\nProbability. A measure of how likely an individual risk is to occur. Also known asl i kelihood .\\nProblem. Negative effect on a project objective arising from occurrence of a threat.\\nProject Risk Management. Project Risk Management includes the processes concerned with conducting\\nrisk management planning, identifi cation, analysis, responses, and monitoring and control on a project. The\\npurpose of Project Risk Management is to increase the probability and impact of positive events and decrease\\nthe probability and impact of events adverse to project objectives.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.

       " 123: 'GLOSSARY\\nResponse Strategy. A high-level approach to address an individual risk or overall project risk, broken down\\ninto a set of risk actions.\\nRisk. An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s\\nobjectives.\\nRisk Action. A detailed task which implements in whole or in part a response strategy in order to address an\\nindividual risk or overall project risk.\\nRisk Action Owner. The person responsible for carrying out the approved risk actions for responding to a\\ngiven risk. Also known as “response owner” when the context allows it.\\nRisk Attitude. A chosen mental disposition towards uncertainty, adopted explicitly or implicitly by individuals\\nand groups, driven by perception, and evidenced by observable behavior. Risk attitude exists on a continuous\\nspectrum, but common risk attitudes include risk averse, risk tolerant, risk neutral and risk seeking.\\nRisk Breakdown Structure (RBS) [Tool] A hierarchically organized depiction of the identifi ed project risks\\narranged by risk category and subcategory that identifi es the various areas and causes of potential risks. The\\nrisk breakdown structure is often tailored to specifi c project types.\\nRisk Category. A group of potential causes of risk. Risk causes may be grouped into categories such as technical,\\nexternal, organizational, environmental, or project management. A category may include subcategories such as\\ntechnical maturity, weather, or aggressive estimating. See also R isk Breakdown Structure (RBS)\\nRisk Exposure. A measure of overall project risk describing the overall effect of identifi ed risks on objectives.\\nRisk Management Plan. The document describing how Project Risk Management will be structured and\\nperformed on the project. It is contained in or is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. The risk\\nmanagement plan can be informal and broadly framed, or formal and highly detailed, based on the needs\\nof the project. Information in the risk management plan varies by application area and project size. The\\nrisk management plan is different from the risk register that contains the list of project risks, the results of\\nrisk analysis, and the risk responses.\\nRisk Metalanguage. A structured description of a risk which separates cause, risk, and effect. A typical risk\\ndescription using risk metalanguage might be in the form: “Because of <cause>, <risk> might occur, which\\nwould lead to <effect>.”\\nRisk Model. A representation of the project including data about project elements and risks that can be\\nanalyzed by quantitative methods.\\nRisk Owner. The person responsible for ensuring that an appropriate response strategy is selected and\\nimplemented, and for determining suitable risk actions to implement the chosen strategy, with each risk action\\nassigned to a single risk action owner.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute. Practice Standard for Project Risk Management\\n111',\n",
       " 124: 'GLOSSARY\\nRisk Register. The document containing the results of the qualitative risk analysis, quantitative risk analysis,\\nand risk response planning. The risk register details all identifi ed risks, including description, category, cause,\\nprobability of occurring, impact(s) on objectives, proposed responses, owners, and current status.\\nRisk Threshold. A measure of the level of risk exposure above which action must be taken to address risks\\nproactively, and below which risks may be accepted.\\nRoot Cause. An initiating cause that gives rise to a causal chain which may give rise to risks.\\nSecondary Risk. A risk that arises as a direct result of implementing a risk response.\\nStakeholder. Person or organization (e.g., customer, sponsor, performing organization, or the public) that is\\nactively involved in the project, or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by execution or\\ncompletion of the project. A stakeholder may also exert infl uence over the project and its deliverables.\\nThreat. A condition or situation unfavorable to the project, a negative set of circumstances, a negative set of\\nevents, a risk that will have a negative impact on a project objective if it occurs, or a possibility for negative\\nchanges. Contrast with opportunity .\\nTrigger Condition. Circumstance under which a risk strategy or risk action will be invoked.\\n©2009 Project Management Institute.
